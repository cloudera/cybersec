# Cyber Functions

A library of functions for calculations and rules useful in a cyber domain, which can be used as FlinkSQL udfs, javascript functions in the rules engine and potentially hive or spark functions.

This is intended as an alternative to the stellar library approach. Some of the functions could arguably be wrapped in Stellar functions.
